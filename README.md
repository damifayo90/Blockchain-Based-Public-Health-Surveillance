```

## Usage Guide

### For Health Authorities

1. **Registration Process**
    - Submit authority credentials through the verification contract
    - Await validation from existing verified authorities
    - Receive blockchain-based certification

2. **Data Submission**
    - Connect authorized wallet
    - Submit health indicators through the data collection interface
    - Monitor submission status and confirmations

### For Public Health Officials

1. **Monitoring Dashboard**
    - Access real-time health trend visualizations
    - Review alert notifications and severity assessments
    - Analyze epidemiological patterns and forecasts

2. **Response Coordination**
    - Activate response protocols through the coordination contract
    - Allocate resources and track intervention progress
    - Collaborate with multiple agencies in real-time

### For the Public

1. **Transparency Portal**
    - View aggregated, anonymized health trends
    - Access public health alerts and recommendations
    - Monitor response effectiveness and resource allocation

## Data Privacy and Security

### Privacy Protection
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Sensitive data verification without exposure
- **Data Anonymization**: Personal identifiers removed before blockchain storage
- **Selective Disclosure**: Granular access control for different stakeholder levels

### Security Measures
- **Multi-Signature Contracts**: Require multiple authorizations for critical actions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical permission system
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable record of all system interactions
- **Smart Contract Security**: Comprehensive testing and formal verification
